# What Am I?

SpeeD ReaD helps you to read faster and more efficiently. By minimizing subvocalization and saccades, you can process and comprehend the text you read much faster than with normal reading.

# How Does it Work?

First, subvocalization is the natural tendency for all of us to "hear" the words in our brains as we read. Think of it as reading out loud inside your head. But our minds do not need us to sound out the words we read - even inside our heads - in order to understand them. The words can be processed in a fraction of the time it takes us to sound them out. SpeeD ReaD forces you to simply comprehend words by sight.

Additionally, as we read blocks of text on a screen or in a book, our eyes tend to vacillate between rapid movements (saccades), as we move to the next word, and stops, as we focus on a word. By showing each word in the same area of the screen, SpeeD ReaD eliminates those unnecessary eye movements.

# Installation

Currently, SpeeDReaD is available for the Microsoft Windows operating
system only. Download the current SpeeDReaD installer (v.2.1.2) and run
it on your computer.

# Using SpeeDReaD

*This information will get you started, but for more in-depth information*
*on using SpeeDReaD, please click “Help” and “Help Topics” in the menu.*

### Screen Layout

When you first run SpeeDReaD, you’ll be greeted with a large reading area and a control panel at the bottom of the screen.

In this control panel, you have a variety of buttons for various functions: an add/change text function where you can paste
text or import text from an epub file, a play/pause button and a stop button, and a settings button, which will open a
popup where you can change the program's settings.

In addition to the buttons, you also have two sliders. The longest one scrolls through the words of the text you are reading
while the shorter one in the bottom-left changes your reading speed.

### Settings

There are various changes that can be made to how SpeeDReaD works. By
clicking the settings button you can change such things as:

- The Font being used
- The Background Color
- Whether or not to pause a bit for punctuation
- Whether or not to combine smaller words (showing two small words at once instead of one)
